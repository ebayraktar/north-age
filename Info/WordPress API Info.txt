WordPress API INFO


Pagination Parameters #Pagination Parameters
Any API response which contains multiple resources supports several common query parameters to handle paging through the response data:

?page=: specify the page of results to return.
For example, /wp/v2/posts?page=2 is the second page of posts results
By retrieving /wp/v2/posts, then /wp/v2/posts?page=2, and so on, you may access every available post through the API, one page at a time.
?per_page=: specify the number of records to return in one request, specified as an integer from 1 to 100.
For example, /wp/v2/posts?per_page=1 will return only the first post in the collection
?offset=: specify an arbitrary offset at which to start retrieving posts
For example, /wp/v2/posts?offset=6 will use the default number of posts per page, but start at the 6th post in the collection
?per_page=5&page=4 is equivalent to ?per_page=5&offset=15
Tip:
Large queries can hurt site performance, so per_page is capped at 100 records. If you wish to retrieve more than 100 records, for example to build a client-side list of all available categories, you may make multiple API requests and combine the results within your application.

To determine how many pages of data are available, the API returns two header fields with every paginated response:

X-WP-Total: the total number of records in the collection
X-WP-TotalPages: the total number of pages encompassing all available records
